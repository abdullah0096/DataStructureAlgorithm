## Problem

A concert organizer is assigning seats to attendees based on their ticket numbers in ascending order. However, due to errors, some attendees are not seated in the correct order. 
The expected seating order is represented by the integer array `expected`, where `expected[i]` is the ticket number of the attendee supposed to sit at the ith position.

You are given an integer array `current` representing the current seating order of attendees (0-indexed). Each `current[i]` is the ticket number of the attendee currently seated at the ith position.

Instead of returning the number of indices where `current[i] != expected[i]`, return **the minimum number of swaps** required to rearrange the attendees in the correct order.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
current = [4, 3, 1, 2]
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
```
Expected array: [1, 2, 3, 4].
To fix the order:
1. Swap positions 0 and 2 -> [1, 3, 4, 2]
2. Swap positions 1 and 3 -> [1, 2, 4, 3]
3. Swap positions 2 and 3 -> [1, 2, 3, 4].
Total swaps = 3.
```

---

### Constraints:
1. `1 <= current.length <= 100`
2. `1 <= current[i] <= 1000`
3. All elements in `current` are unique.
