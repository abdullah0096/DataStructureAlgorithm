## Problem 1

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of three numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice in any combination.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 4, 9, 10]
target = 12
```

**Output:**
```
[0, 1, 3]
```

**Explanation:**
```
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[3] == 12, so we return [0, 1, 3].
```

---

### Constraints:
1. `3 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
2. `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
3. `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`



## Problem 2

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find two distinct pairs of indices `(i, j)` and `(k, l)` such that the sums of the numbers at these indices are equal to `target`.

You may assume there will always be at least one such pair in the input.

Return the indices as a list of two pairs: `[[i, j], [k, l]]`. The order of indices within and between pairs does not matter.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
nums = [2, 1, 7, 3, 4]
target = 6
```

**Output:**
```
[[0, 3], [1, 4]]
```

**Explanation:**
```
nums[0] + nums[3] == nums[1] + nums[4] == 6, so we return [[0, 3], [1, 4]].
```

---

### Constraints:
1. `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
2. `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
3. `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
