# Data Structure and Algorithms

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This repository is meant to be a starting point for solving data structure and algorithms problems from LeetCode. Aim here is to solve around 75-100 problems from leet code from scratch.  
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="./programList.md" targer="_blank">This List </a> contains problems from Leetcode. Solving them in the given order should be helpful.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="./DataStructures/" target="_blank"> This directory </a> contains theory about all major data structures in brief. Theory about each data structure is given in a separate file.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="./extra_programs/" target="_blank"> This directory</a> contains extra practice problems. Every problem name name <a href="./programList.md" target="_blank"> leet code list </a> is preceded by a number, this number is used as file name in this directory. After solving a problem from leet code, a corresponding problem can be solved from this directory using the number from problem name. The problems in this directory are of similar difficulty level as the one with the same number on leet code.
