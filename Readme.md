# Data Structure and Algorithms

This repository is meant to be a starting point for solving data structure and algorithms problems from LeetCode.

[This List](./programList.md) contains problems. Solving them in the given order should be helpful.

[This directory](./extra_programs/) contains short descriptions about most major data structures.

> A list of famous algorithms that CS students should know is available [here.](./MustKnowAlgorithmList.pdf)
